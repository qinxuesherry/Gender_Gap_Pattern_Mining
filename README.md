# AIMD Lab Project: Gender Gap Pattern Mining in Mathematics Scores
## Overview
The AIMD Lab Project focuses on analyzing the gender gap in mathematics scores across the United States from 2000 to 2022. By leveraging data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), this research aims to uncover trends in the gender gap and how it has evolved over the years. The project employs the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm to identify and analyze patterns of gender disparity in mathematics achievement across different states, aiming to correlate these trends with local education policies.

## Objectives
**Trend Analysis**: To investigate the trend of the gender gap in mathematics scores over a 22-year period.
**Pattern Mining**: To employ the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm for mining sequential patterns in gender gap trends across 50 states.
Policy Correlation: To examine the relationship between identified gender gap trends and local education policies, providing insights for targeted interventions.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), focusing on mathematics scores. It encompasses a wide range of demographic and performance data across multiple years, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of gender disparities in educational outcomes.

## Methodology
**Data Collection**: Gather and preprocess data from NAEP, focusing on mathematics scores from 2000 to 2022.
**Trend Analysis**: Analyze the data to identify overall trends in the gender gap over the specified period.
**Pattern Mining**: Apply the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm to mine for sequential patterns and similarities in gender gap trends across the 50 states.
**Policy Correlation**: Investigate the correlation between identified patterns and local education policies to understand potential influences and areas for policy intervention.

## Technologies Used
**Dynamic Time Warping Algorithm**: For effective sequence mining and pattern recognition in time-series data.
**Python**: Data cleanning, EDA, DTW application and plots
**R**: Clustering analysis
**Matplotlib**: Correlation Heatmap, Line Plots, and etc.
